# CTEC3905 Assignment

This assignment consists of a single page web application designed for an imaginary photography studio in order to show their work.

# Notes

#### Pictures

- Every picture used in this project were taken from the stock photography website [unsplah](https://unsplash.com/).

#### API

- Bing Imagery API was used in order to create a static map with a marker location.

#### CSS

- Initially I was not being able to validate the CSS as most validators throw a `Parse Error` due to the use of the CSS3 variable feature. More on this topic can be found on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57661659/w3c-css-validation-parse-error-on-variables) stackoverflow thread. However, I was able to find [this](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) validator which I used instead.
